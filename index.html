     It’s been many years since I started driving, 1990 to be more specific. Chicago was the city where I began my new life  after immigrating from Eastern Europe. I simply enjoyed driving on those Chicago streets. Some wide and others narrower. While driving I would look out my window in awe. There was so much to explore in this great city. As spring turned into summer, I would roll down the window, happy to welcome in the fresh air. All the while, appreciating the change in season. Even on those hot summer days, I religiously rolled down that window. Considering the air conditioner was hardly reliable, as it constantly broke down in the presence of extreme heat. It was either the the freon evaporates or the lack of power to cool off the inside of my Chevy Malibu station wagon. I had no concerns getting on the road. I was always certain that if I obeyed the rules of the road then I would be fine.<br><br>


<h4>Things started changing…</h4> <br>


    It was somewhere in 2003, though I might not be correct as far as the year, when I started seeing signs “red light photo enforced”. At first not paying much attention, but after a while began hearing about people getting tickets in the mail for passing intersections on a red light. Thinking that they are limiting numbers in a city I did not think much of it.<br><br>


   <h4>New experiences surfaced as a professional driver…</h4> <br>


      Almost four years ago I joined Uber ride sharing services. My life has changed ever since. I am a driver. I am on the road almost every day, spending quite a few hours driving. One thing I realized pretty quickly was the red light photo enforced cameras and speed traps popping up everywhere in the city and many suburbs. It is now in hundreds according to the available official information. 
  Well, I would like to put a pause here and let you know the reason I actually started this post. It is not to repeat the statistics of, for, and against this photo camera network available from different sources. Nor would I like to get into the corruption cases following the decision to implement this network in Chicago. Also, I am not interested to go against “indisputable” scientific research results provided by Northwestern University. As you probably now know these results are used by the city of Chicago to make decisions on new locations for red light enforced cameras to be installed. So, the reason I want to share my experience and thoughts on this issue is to show the effect of this network on my driving while facing dozens of those cameras daily. 
<br><br> 


<h4>The constant stress associated with photo enforced cameras on a road…</h4> <br>
 
    Driving in Chicago these days is not easy in general considering the increase in traffic. There are those who already put blame on ride sharing services for that, let alone dealing with the red light and speed photo cameras. <br><br>


<h4>Personal experiences as a driver…</h4><br>
                
As I approach the intersections which are equipped with cameras I mentally prepare and try to assess the situation around me. No doubt, my stress level rising, even though I’ve done this a thousand times. I almost forgot to mention my savior Waze GPS application. Thanks to the creators of this app I can see what is on the road ahead. That includes all those cameras (or almost all) on its map. Waze app normally notifies me as I’m approaching red light or speed trap camera half a mile away. As soon as I get closer I have to make a decision either to accelerate or slow down and stop. No matter how well I assess the situation with traffic in mind, sometimes a split second decision to stop or pass on a yellow light (hopefully no less than 3 seconds) has to be made. I know I always go against computer that will not forgive me my split second mistake. The danger of making a mistake and getting into a dangerous situation at this point is very high. <br><br>


Right turns can also be a challenge, since we naturally slow down approaching those turns. If green changes to yellow while approaching the right turn, two options exist: One to slam on the breaks and hopefully stop on that white so called traffic line or accelerate and hopefully crossing that white traffic lane before the traffic light changes to red. Sometimes unexpected pedestrians can start crossing the street I’m about to turn into and the danger of a series accident increase significantly. <br><br>


Another scenario can also occur on suburban high speed roads with speed limits 45-55 mph. These can be tricky ones too. I have to be more aware of the stopping distance in case I choose to apply my brakes. So, if I see that the light is changing from green to yellow and I am still a couple hundred or less feet away from a white traffic line then the decision to stop or get through is not an easy one. Let’s not forget about adding on slippery road conditions during the rough Chicago winters. From my personal experience I mostly just accelerate since I know I can travel long distances at these speeds during those at least three seconds, which might be even longer in the suburbs. <br><br>


There are intersections that have red light cameras and speed traps installed in sequence one right after another. You may wonder what happens in these situations? if you passed the intersection and did not slow down to 20 or 30 mph? Well, hopefully you crossed it on a green light, but they still got you in the end for speeding. Ha ha ha…! <br><br>

Now think about it, all these mental calculations, stress, and preparations can go away if only you can approach an intersection without cameras installed, driving would be less stressful, chances of making a mistake under stress much lower. <br><br> 

Also, what about those less experienced or older drivers that simply do not react fast enough, got confused or made a mistake. How many of those are getting ticketed? <br><br>

There are some long streets in Chicago that if you drive on them for a few miles you will encounter a whole bunch of cameras. After driving through one of them myself I often say: “Well, hopefully I made it this time again.”<br><br>

<h4>Some thoughts at the end…</h4><br>
             
      So, what is the idea behind this network? Is it meant to stop the reckless drivers or the careless drivers from blowing red lights? 
   The data found in some of the articles I researched showed the amount of money collected in a city is about $65 millions on average per year and changing slightly from year to year. Even more money in total collected in suburbs. So, even though the effect of the network on safety, as mentioned in many articles I looked at, is very controversial, the amount of money that is collected annually by the local governments is very real. Also, looking at these insignificant changes in the amount of money collected from year to year tells me that the number of violations is not actually going down. Yet the numbers of those who are actually reckless drivers are minorities. The majority though have to put up with an extra level of stress on the road and a much less pleasant driving experience. 
 In conclusion, I wrote this post, as a driver myself and on behalf of many other drivers on the road, just to let it go, and express my frustration. 
 I protest red light and speed photo enforced cameras. Join me if you have similar feelings about this and let's protest together! Let’s keep this conversation going.
